A sleek, cinematic web app inspired by *Netflix* true crime documentaries. Users can explore, analyze, and play amateur sleuth with real-life cases.

## Demo Preview  
*Coming Soon*

## Features
- **Random Case Generator** — Randomly displays true-crime cases with every click.  
- **Dynamic Content:** Every card receives a unique case from the dataset.
- **Cinematic Transitions** — Smooth fade-in / fade-out reveals give cases a Netflix investigative feel.  
- **Scalable Design:** Built for future expansion, including databases or API-fetched cases.

## Tech Stack
| Category | Technologies Used |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Frontend | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6) |
| Design & Styling | Flexbox, CSS transitions, gradient themes |
| Future Integrations | Firebase, Node.js, Express, API integration for backend expansion|
| Tools | Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code |

## Data Sample / Sources
This app uses curated data inspired by the [FBI Historic Cases Archive] (https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases).

## Future Roadmap
### **Phase 1: Core MVP**
- [x] Randomized true-crime card content per refresh  
- [x] Cinematic fade transitions  
- [ ] “My Vault” feature: save favorite cases (LocalStorage)  
- [ ] Search or filter cases by type, region, or time period  
- [ ] Thematic sound effects & subtle background ambient sound  
- [ ] Fully responsive layout using grid/flex design  
 
### **Phase 2: Interactive Enhancements**
- [ ] **Case Profiles:** Pop-up cards with detailed bios, timeline visuals, and media assets  
- [ ] **User Notes:** Sticky notes or comments panel next to each case  
- [ ] **Dark Mode Themes:** Movie-style red, blue, and neutral noir presets  
- [ ] **Case of the Day:** Automatically featured randomization  
- [ ] **Badge System:** Rewards for case exploration streaks (“Master Detective,” “Cold Case Analyst”)  
- [ ] **Hotkeys:** Keyboard controls (e.g., “R” for Next Case, “S” for Save)  

### **Phase 3: Data & Back-End Integration**
- [ ] Integrate a cloud database (Firebase / MongoDB Atlas)  
- [ ] Build secure user profiles with authentication (email + OAuth)  
- [ ] Add CREATE/EDIT UI for adding custom cases  
- [ ] Expand dataset with public FBI or Wikipedia APIs  
- [ ] Tagging system (“Unsolved,” “Organized Crime,” “Fraud”)  
- [ ] Build sortable and paginated archive view  

### **Phase 4: Social & Collaborative Features**
- [ ] Allow users to share or export “My Vaults”  
- [ ] Add simple follow/favorite functionality for community curation  
- [ ] Global leaderboard (most viewed or saved cases)  
- [ ] Comment and theory thread per case  
- [ ] Build “Top 10 True Crime Mysteries” lists (community-curated)  
- [ ] Public vs Private vault toggle 

### **Phase 5: Portfolio Expansion**
- [ ] Connect backend (Node.js / Express API) + database  
- [ ] Automated fetch of live FBI case updates  
- [ ] Add analytics dashboard (view history, crime type patterns)  
- [ ] “Behind the Scenes” developer log page for showcasing progress  
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite (Jest, Cypress)  
- [ ] Deploy on GitHub Pages → migrate to Netlify or Vercel 

## Stretch Goals (Creative Expansions)
- Interactive **crime map visualization**  
- AI-based “Investigator Mode” (uses NLP to summarize or link similar cases)  
- Add voice narration overlays for accessibility or immersion  
- “Crime Recommender” engine — suggests related cases based on user vault contents  
- Build presentation mode for displaying your collection like episodes

## Developer Notes
True Crime Tracker is a purpose-driven, project-based learning application. This is an ongoing project developed as part of a self-directed full-stack learning initiative. The project aims to apply critical front-end principles, from responsive CSS layout to dynamic JavaScript interactivity, within a creatively guided, thematic concept that bridges technical learning and storytelling. 

**This project reinforces proficiency in:**
- DOM manipulation and interactive JavaScript  
- Semantic HTML and modular CSS architecture  
- Responsive design via Flexbox and media queries  
- Animations and transitions for cinematic UI experiences  
- Git-based version control and collaborative development practices

**Key learning objectives and professional takeaways include:**
- Strengthening understanding of JS interactivity and the Document Object Model (DOM)
- Enhancing visual design principles through theme-based projects
- Reinforcing workflow fundamentals (Git, GitHub, modular file structure)
- Experimenting with scalable architecture for future backend/API integration
- Developing documentation that aligns with industry standards

Future enhancements will focus on expanding the project into a full-stack environment with persistent data storage, user authentication, and third-party API integrations. The application’s long-term goal is to evolve beyond a static simulator into a full‑stack learning artifact.
